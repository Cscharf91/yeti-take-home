# Get Started:

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start React App:
  
```bash
npm start
```

Open in browser at `http://localhost:3000` (which should automatically happen) and you're good to go!

# Tests:

To run the (very basic) tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

# Quick Note:

I added TypeScript to this project because:
1. I love TypeScript
2. It was mentioned in the tech stack on the job posting.

I'm aware that TypeScript is extremely unnecessary for a project of this size with no interactivity or data-driven logic, but I included it mainly for reason #2 above.

## Thanks for the opportunity! Looking forward to hearing back!
