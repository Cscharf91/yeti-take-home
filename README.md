# Yeti Take Home

# Get Started:

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start React App:
  
```bash
npm start
```

Open in browser at `http://localhost:3000` (which should automatically happen) and you're good to go!

# Tests:

To run the (very basic) tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

# Quick Notes:

* Try clicking on the menu on the top! I added a small slide-out menu using the `useState` hook and CSS transitions. It's also responsive for mobile.

* I added TypeScript to this project because:
    1. I love TypeScript
    2. It was mentioned in the tech stack on the job posting.

  I'm aware that TypeScript is extremely unnecessary for a project of this size with little interactivity and without data-driven logic, but I included it mainly for reason #2 above for demonstration purposes.

## Thanks for the opportunity! Looking forward to hearing back!
